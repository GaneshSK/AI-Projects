Objective:
Building User verfication for Banking applications using PAN card verification to detect tampering of the ID using Computer vision

Why? 
1. Financial applications and products in India require user and thier financial account verification and that is done through PAN card and/or Aadhar card 
2. Currently to onboard a user into banking, in India we deploy human resources for validating and aprpoving user information in online KYC process
3. While that is faster, is there an opportunity to detect PAN Card and store the PAN card details and check at the backend for user id validation, verification


Note: This is not something that is not available in the market, rather it is a building block that I am building for my proof of concept and a module for my bigger application

Impact -
- Cost Savings
- Time to onboard
- Verification and security impact 

Tech stack
1. OpenCV for computer vision
2. Training & Testing Dataset from Kaggle, if available
3. Flask
4. Heroku for Deployment

Constraints:
1. PII information handling
2. Data security
3. Encryption of the PAN number
3. Availability of rich set of training data
                                  

Workflow
1. Get image from the user
2. Check for format & size
3. Change size and shape accordingly
4. Convert image to grayscale
5. Find similarity index of the images
6. Find threshold of the image
7. Using IMUTILS grab the contour
8. Draw bounding rectangle using contours
9. Plot difference, threshold
10. Compare all images and check similarity score

Building User verfication for Banking applications using PAN card verification.
Why? 
1. Financial applications and products require user verification and that is done through PAN card / Aadhar card or any other Government ID proofs
2. Currently to onboard a user into banking, in India we deploy human resources for validating and aprpoving user information in online KYC process
3. While that is faster, is there an opportunity to detect PAN Card and store the PAN card details and check at the backend for user id validation, verification

Impact - Work in progress
- Cost Savings
- Time to onboard
- Verification and security impact
